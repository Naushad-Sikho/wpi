              <p>
                On the world map, India is a happening place now. Our successful
                experiment of an independent democratic society has become an
                exemplary model in itself. Our economic growth is attracting the
                worldwide attention. The world is in awe of the talents of our
                scientists, technocrats, and professionals. The Indians are
                consistently escalating their ratio among the wealthiest
                individuals in the world.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                But the tragedy of this splendid advancement is that its fruits
                are viciously confined to a tiny section of the society. Despite
                of this unprecedented growth, the majority of our people are not
                able to fulfil even their basic needs. We are among the fastest
                growing economies, but still more than half of the world’s
                poorest, hungriest and the most deprived people live in our
                country.

              We didn’t fight the war of independence just to get rid of the
              British. The objective was not to replace the white masters by
              black masters. This heroic saga of our proud history was derived
              by a noble vision. The objective wasn’t merely to alter the hands
              that were ruling. The objective was rather to change the style and
              way of ruling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Six decades after achieving independence, this dream is still
              unfulfilled. Corruption has become such an irrepressible menace
              that the whole system seems to be helpless before it. Everyone
              recognises the presence of this fatal disorder, but no one seems
              to have any cure for it. Political institutions of all levels are
              totally in its clutch. Its ruinous impact has paralysed the
              bureaucracy. And now media and judiciary are also getting spoiled.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last few years have witnessed the emergence of a new
              institutionalised variety of corruption. This new form, powered by
              a well-coordinated nexus between the ruling and opposition
              politicians, corporate leaders, their lobbyists and media tycoons,
              has the capability to influence the decisions and policy making at
              the highest levels. This situation can push the country to the
              worst kind of economic chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
              A major factor contributing to this situation is the flawed
              developmental vision of our rulers. Under this vision, the whole
              focus is on creating the wealth; regardless of the origins and the
              sources of the new wealth, regardless of its target beneficiaries
              and regardless of the kind of compromises this wealth creation is
              demanding on the sovereignty and dignity of the nation. Instead of
              the interest of a common Indian, the interest of domestic and
              global capitalists has become the main decisive factor for Policy
              formulation. The role of the state has confined to providing the
              opportunities for the growth and development of the businesses of
              the corporate houses and to eliminate the hindrances from their
              path. Agriculture and Agro-economy is in crisis. The opportunities
              in rural areas are shrinking; the share of agriculture in GDP is
              fast declining and in rural and urban India a poor man is always
              under threat of displacement. The economy based on usury and
              speculation is concentrating the wealth in a few hands. Many rural
              households are left with no alternative except migrating to a city
              and living there in extreme sub-human conditions.
            </p>
            <h2>VISION AND VALUES</h2>
            <p>
              Value base Politics: Party shall try to promote an alternative
              politics in the country that is firmly rooted in high standards of
              morality and ethical values and that is free from crimes,
              corruption, selfishness and all kinds of narrow-minded prejudices.
              It will require making effective the mechanisms of accountability
              and transparency at all levels of public life and ensuring that
              authority and power are always coupled with an equal magnitude of
              responsibility and answerability, and flawless character become
              the prime-most prerequisite for political representation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Idea of a Welfare State: Party will aim at the establishment
              of a welfare state. Party believes that sufficient nutritious
              food, decent clothing, proper shelter, essential healthcare and
              elementary education are among the fundamental human rights and it
              is the duty of a welfare state to fulfil these basic needs of each
              of its citizens.
            </p>

            <p>
              Development with Justice and Equality: Party envisages speedy
              growth in industry, trade, commerce and the national economy. But
              it shall try to reform the economy in a way as to ensure that the
              processes of development and wealth creation are properly
              regulated by the obligations of justice and equality. Humanity and
              human beings get precedence over economy and capital.
              Concentration of wealth is curbed and all the Indians get
              benefitted from the fruits of development. Economic development
              should also uplift the backward and downtrodden sections along
              with the industrialists and businessmen. Concerns for
              sustainability and the protection of environment should also
              formulate an important regulator of the development.
            </p>

            <p>
              Democracy, Pluralism and Inclusiveness: Party shall promote the
              true spirit of democracy. Party believes in democracy not in the
              sense of mere majorityism but in the sense of inclusiveness and
              pluralism. A true democratic society is one that addresses the
              needs and demands of every section of the society and that ensures
              that every section contentedly fulfils its aspirations. The ideal
              society that party envisages will be founded on the notion of
              universal human brotherhood. It will make people of India grow
              above the narrow discriminations based on caste, community, region
              and language and nourish the spirit of unity in diversity. This
              notion of universal brotherhood implies that a warm hand of
              cooperation is raised to the weak and oppressed sections of the
              society and minorities, they are uplifted through special measures
              and affirmative actions and it is ensured that they get a
              dignified place in society and do not lag behind in the race of
              progress. It also implies that women should get full Growth and
              development opportunities with full protection to their feminity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Cultural Federalism: Party envisages a society where all cultures
              have full opportunities to thrive and develop. The concept of
              federalism that party believes covers the cultural federalism
              along with geographic and linguistic federalism. What it means is,
              in a culturally diverse society like India, all cultural entities
              should get fullest opportunities, resources and powers to protect
              and promote their cultural values and identities. The Party
              proposes a notion of democracy where the rights of cultural groups
              are also protected along with the rights of individuals.
