                The most important factor responsible for this situation is the
                peculiar political culture that has built up in our society.
                This culture that is grown on the foundations of corruption,
                nepotism, caste and community favouritism, elitism and dynastic
                polity can never ensure justice to everyone. Exploitation,
                oppression, treachery and narrow-minded bigotry are the
                indispensable and logical outcome of this culture. The biggest
                casualty of this culture is merit and talent. The worthy and
                able individuals get detached from the process of leadership and
                nation-building and the charge of the nation goes in the hands
                of undeserving mediocres.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                The national political parties are fully under the influence of
                corporate groups. A large number of corrupt politicians have
                infiltrated in them. The totalitarian leaning and anti-minority
                bias of a mainstream party is well-known. The parties, who were
                so far considered the champions of poor and downtrodden, have
                either succumbed to the capitalist influence or their obsolete
                ideology and class politics can no longer go with the
                aspirations of the new India. The small parties that could have
                become their alternatives are so seized in the narrow circles of
                their regional and sectarian interests that they also cannot
                promote real justice and equality. It therefore implies that
                there is no political force that is capable of providing
                universal justice and with which every Indian can associate his
                or her hopes.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                The main reason of this situation is the worst kind of
                materialism that has taken the whole country into its grip. This
                is greed and gluttony that makes a man unworthy of pursuing any
                great ideal selflessly. After business, industry and
                bureaucracy, now politics and public service are also under the
                grasp of this greed and gluttony.
              </p>
              <p>
                In creating a passion for selfless service characterized by
                great ideals, the fear of God and spirituality plays a pivotal
                role. Unfortunately, in the politics of our country, the
                religion has always been used to create differences, to polarize
                the society and to exploit the weak. In a religious society like
                India, the religious and spiritual values can play a
                constructive role in bringing about a healthy social change. The
                secular constitution of India should not be a barrier for this.
                Because the constitution does not oppose spirituality, it
                opposes the discrimination between religions. It is necessary to
                connect the politics with high moral standards on the basis of
                spiritual and moral values of religions.
