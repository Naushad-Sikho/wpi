                The national political parties are fully under the influence of corporate groups. A large number of corrupt politicians have infiltrated in them. The totalitarian leaning and anti-minority bias of a mainstream party is well-known. The parties, who were so far considered the champions of poor and downtrodden, have either succumbed to the capitalist influence or their obsolete ideology and class politics can no longer go with the aspirations of the new India. The small parties that could have become their alternatives are so seized in the narrow circles of their regional and sectarian interests that they also cannot promote real justice and equality. It therefore implies that there is no political force that is capable of providing universal justice and with which every Indian can associate his or her hopes.
