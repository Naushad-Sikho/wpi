                The million dollar question is how the much-needed political reform can be accomplished. For this, just change of hands is not sufficient. The entry of some new leaders or parties is also not adequate. Any superficial or mechanical change will not either suffice. What our body politic needs is a paradigm shift, a kind of metamorphosis, a change from the deep roots. It requires massive social awakening. It demands alternative political culture; the new political traditions and environment. We need to wear off the connection between politics and capital. We need to make an end to the unhealthy penchant of considering politics a profession and a wealth creation tool. We need to wipe out the tendency of considering politics a weapon in communal, casteist and sectarian conflicts. Politics will have to be cleansed form crimes and criminals. The criminalisation of Politics, the Communalisation of Politics, the Commercialisation of Politics and the Sectarianisation of Politics are the biggest evils of our prevailing political culture. We need to erect a mighty social and public resistance against these evils. This should bring forth and make prevalent such individuals in politics who are driven by high ideals and moral standards and who aim at the justice and welfare of all Indians.
              </p>
              <p>It is with these dreams that a few concerned citizens have come forward to establish Welfare Party. This party will comprise the individuals having record of flawless public service and who are able to fight and offer sacrifices for some values and ideals. The party will include people from all communities, classes and social groups and only those individuals will be allowed an entry into the party who can prove by word and deed, their commitment to the values and vision of the party. This party shall strive for thriving an alternative politics and shall attempt to emerge on the horizon of Indian politics as the voice of voiceless, the hope for justice and as a harbinger of a new India.</p>
         <p>This will not be just another party engaged in power politics. This will be rather a movement for reforming the Indian Politics and will try to realise a welfare state based on moral values and governed by the principles of Justice, Freedom, Equality and Fraternity. To achieve this objective, the Party will launch massive public campaigns and will awaken the socio-political public consciousness. It will try to inculcate in common man the self esteem, the self confidence and the ambition and courage to fight the oppression and exploitation. It will try to promote able and virtuous leadership among masses and shall try to advance alternative politics in the country through this social struggle.</p>
