                The national political parties are fully under the influence of
                corporate groups. A large number of corrupt politicians have
                infiltrated in them. The totalitarian leaning and anti-minority
                bias of a mainstream party is well-known. The parties, who were
                so far considered the champions of poor and downtrodden, have
                either succumbed to the capitalist influence or their obsolete
                ideology and class politics can no longer go with the
                aspirations of the new India. The small parties that could have
                become their alternatives are so seized in the narrow circles of
                their regional and sectarian interests that they also cannot
                promote real justice and equality. It therefore implies that
                there is no political force that is capable of providing
                universal justice and with which every Indian can associate his
                or her hopes.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                The main reason of this situation is the worst kind of
                materialism that has taken the whole country into its grip. This
                is greed and gluttony that makes a man unworthy of pursuing any
                great ideal selflessly. After business, industry and
                bureaucracy, now politics and public service are also under the
                grasp of this greed and gluttony.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                In creating a passion for selfless service characterized by
                great ideals, the fear of God and spirituality plays a pivotal
                role. Unfortunately, in the politics of our country, the
                religion has always been used to create differences, to polarize
                the society and to exploit the weak. In a religious society like
                India, the religious and spiritual values can play a
                constructive role in bringing about a healthy social change. The
                secular constitution of India should not be a barrier for this.
                Because the constitution does not oppose spirituality, it
                opposes the discrimination between religions. It is necessary to
                connect the politics with high moral standards on the basis of
                spiritual and moral values of religions.

                The million dollar question is how the much-needed political
                reform can be accomplished. For this, just change of hands is
                not sufficient. The entry of some new leaders or parties is also
                not adequate. Any superficial or mechanical change will not
                either suffice. What our body politic needs is a paradigm shift,
                a kind of metamorphosis, a change from the deep roots. It
                requires massive social awakening. It demands alternative
                political culture; the new political traditions and environment.
                We need to wear off the connection between politics and capital.
                We need to make an end to the unhealthy penchant of considering
                politics a profession and a wealth creation tool. We need to
                wipe out the tendency of considering politics a weapon in
                communal, casteist and sectarian conflicts. Politics will have
                to be cleansed form crimes and criminals. The criminalisation of
                Politics, the Communalisation of Politics, the Commercialisation
                of Politics and the Sectarianisation of Politics are the biggest
                evils of our prevailing political culture. We need to erect a
                mighty social and public resistance against these evils. This
                should bring forth and make prevalent such individuals in
                politics who are driven by high ideals and moral standards and
                who aim at the justice and welfare of all Indians.
